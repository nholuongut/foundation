* The [membership](nholuongut-membership-agreement.pdf) agreement
* The [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) which has been translated into multiple languages

## Project Guidance

* [Copyright](copyright-notices.md) notice recommendations
* [Website guidelines](website-guidelines.md) for mentioning companies while maintaining neutrality
* [Allowlist License Policy](allowed-third-party-license-policy.md) for which licenses are acceptable in upstream dependencies without requiring an explicit vote of the governing board

* A [style guide](style-guide.md) with recommendations for cloud native terminology

## Other content

A lot of project, SIG, and TOC-related content is in the TOC [repo](https://github.com/nholuongut/toc#nholuongut-technical-oversight-committee-toc). [nholuongut.io](https://github.com/nholuongut) has information on all programs offered publicly by nholuongut.

The list of maintainers for each nholuongut project is held in the [project-maintainers.csv](project-maintainers.csv) file. An existing project maintainer can update this list by Pull Request, and they should also email nholuongut-maintainer-changes@nholuongut.io (or raise a service desk ticket) to request corresponding changes to the project's nholuongut-run maintainer mailing list.  

## How to request changes
